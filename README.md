1. Creating an account on GitHub


- GitHub is a web-based interface that is useful for group work because it is open source and allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time.
- Use the following link to navigate to the GitHub website to create an account: https://github.com/join
- You will need an email (business or school email recommended) to completely setup an account.
- After the account is made, click the icon on the upper right corner of the home page. There is a drop down option labeled "Your Profile", use this to customize your account appearance snd information.

2. Git download


- Git is a program used for the GitHub interface, and in order to use GitHub properly it is recommended to download.
- In order to download Git, use the following link: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Depending on the device being used (Windows, MacOS, Linux), click on the appropriate link, which will take you to the download page.
- At the top of the page it will state (I am using Windows so this might show slightly differently): "Click here to download the latest (2.35.1) 64-bit version of Git for Windows." This is the version that should be downloaded.
- After downloading, it will take you through the installation process. Once the process is finished, if you search "Git" on your computer, Git Bash, Git GUI, and Git CMD will show.
- Git can be accessed directly to commit and push changes made in an IDE such as Visual Studio, or can be used by an IDE such as Webstorm to commit and push from there. If Git is being used directly, here is a cheatsheet of commands needed: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html
