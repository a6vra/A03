1. Creating an account on GitHub


- GitHub is a web-based interface that is useful for group work because it is open source and allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time.
- Use the following link to navigate to the GitHub website to create an account: https://github.com/join
- You will need an email (business or school email recommended) to completely setup an account.
- After the account is made, click the icon on the upper right corner of the home page. There is a drop down option labeled "Your Profile", use this to customize your account appearance snd information.
